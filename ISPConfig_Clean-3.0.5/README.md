ISPConfig_Clean-3.0.5
=====================

Clean theme for ISPConfig 3.0.5 and above. 


Installation
------------

1. Copy the interface folder to your /usr/local/ispconfig/
2. Edit /usr/local/ispconfig/interface/lib/config.inc.php default theme to ispc-clean
3. Edit the header logo location. Change default to ispc-clean is all that needs to be done.
4. Import the SQL file inside of the SQL folder to setup the table structure in the ISPConfig Database.
5. Enjoy the theme. I will be making changes as I have time.

Recent Changes
--------------

I have added a customizable login sidebar to the theme. Please let me know what you think. It is all controlled in the Admin section of ISPConfig, and it is dynamically genertated! It should be helpful for your customers to not have to login to get to important places.
